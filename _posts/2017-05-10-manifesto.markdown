We must all of us rejoice that there is now so much material available
for Latin. The number of intelligible books for first-year Latin students
is exploding, and we are coming to realize the importance of communication.

We have, however, a calamity in the making. The goal is always more input,
more intelligible input, more compelling input. This is, of course, hard in
the early stages—how do we say something interesting with 40 words? We can
get away with one or two simple stories, but soon we run out of ideas, and
it seems that we will have to introduce too many new words in order to
make the next story.

<!-- more -->

Faced with this challenge, many of us have chosen a dangerous
solution: random violence, limitless inanity, unrelenting immaturity.
Lady Gaga attacks Donald Trump; Richard Stallman sends weapons of mass
destruction to Google; and then they all explode. We sacrifice all
decorum, all artistry, all of our higher nature to the single goal of
getting students to listen to Latin.

And maybe it works. I have not gone that far, but maybe, all else
equal, a class will learn more Latin if you act like a buffoon.

But is it worth it? By doing this, what are we telling our students?
Do we really want to encourage 3rd-grade thought-patterns in our
students? There is already too much blatant stupidity in our popular
culture. Do we need to validate that to our students?

And are we really being communicative when we are communicating just to
communicate in a particular language? Are we communicating when we tell
stories so horrid and idiotic that we would be embarrassed to tell
them to anybody outside of the context of language learning?

Besides, I believe we have an alternative. We can, in fact, make
compelling stories that have at least a *bit* of substance to them. We
can make stories that students will still listen to, even without a
gory death every couple of sentences, or some pop-culture icon falling
from the sky. We can teach Latin communicatively, and we do not need
to write Latin scripts for *Beavis and Butthead* to do so.

We make these kinds of stories for the same reason that people tell
dirty jokes: because it is *easy*. Any fool with a nasty mind can do
it. But if we want to make a really good, clean joke—no violence,
nothing obscene, nothing racist or morbid—you might actually
have to think.

So *of course* we often end up with weird, random stuff in CI. We
are engaging in a very difficult literary challenge and acting like we
can just wing it. If we are going to come up with awesome stories that
will engage students so much we can teach them Latin in just 50
minutes a day, it will be hard.

So to dig through the massive heap of CI trash in search of the
stories that are worth telling, I have set up this site to review
books for teaching Latin.
