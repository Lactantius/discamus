Before I rant about some other books, I want to praise this one.

## The Physical Book

This is a 7x5 paperback. The story itself is 73 pages, the
glossary is 15, and the whole book is 96. The paper is cheap and soon
turns yellow, but is good enough for this sort of thing. The glue
seems sturdy.

## Format & Typography

There is not enough margin space at the sides for writing notes,
except at quotations. Between the lines, however, you will find
something more than an eighth of an inch, which might be enough for
you. There are mistakes here and there in the font; for example, the
long vowels in the table of contents are the wrong size. On top of
that, the whole thing is poorly laid out, and they used a sans serif
font. So please note, TPRS Publishing: your books are ugly. On the
other hand, I know that most people don’t really care about these
things.

## Illustrations

The 66 illustrations do a good job showing the plot. They are plain
and simple drawings. They’re not really pretty, but not so disgusting
as in many books for education. I don’t understand why so many books
for kids are full of hideous pictures. Probably because Marxists came
up with a plan to corrupt the taste of American youth.

## Plot

Brandon Brown wants a dog for his fast-approaching ninth birthday. His
mother is hard to convince. But he finds a puppy in the park and hides
it in his room. Brando then has to pretend to be crazy to cover up the
rather obvious signs, and a doctor says that he needs lots of sleep.
Fearing that he might not get to celebrate his birthday, he secretly
returns the dog to the park, where a girl recognizes it. He then
returns home and declares that he is well. Since his family never knew
about the dog, Brandon’s dad give him a dog for his birthday. But by
now he thinks that dogs are a real pain.

If you read my manifesto, you will perhaps say that I hate this story.
The characters are not deep or noble. It does not uplift the mind. So
why do should we want it? Because the beginner’s brain works so hard
just in understanding what is going on in the story. ACTFL did have
the right idea when they said philosophy should be left to advanced
students. It would of course be nice if we could write uplifting
stories for new students; but in a way it is better and easier for
them to learn about home life in stories about home, so they can say
things about their own lives.

Besides that, this book has an actual plot. I have read so many
stories full of exploding elephants that now I am delighted with
anything that has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and where
everything happens according to the necessary and the probable.
