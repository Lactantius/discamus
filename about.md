I am Gerard Keiser, a very opinionated Latin teacher in Saint Cloud, 
Minnesota, where I have been teaching since 2014. 

This site cannot accept comments. If you have one, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/Lactantius/discamus/issues) on 
Github. I am particularly happy to have comments that vigorously 
disagree, or that point out better ways of saying technical stuff in 
Latin.

The layout is rather plain at the moment, but I thought it better to 
start writing instead of obsessing over presentation for too long. 
Besides, I hate fancy websites, especially those with flashy cosmetic
features that require JavaScript.

## Technical Acknowledgements

Thank you to the innumerable programmers who make modern websites
possible, but especially to the [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com)
team, and to the system administrators who keep all the servers
running.
